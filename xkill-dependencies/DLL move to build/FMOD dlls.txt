"fmod_event.dll" and "fmodex.dll" needs to be in the same folder as the executable file.
Failed doing this automatically through Visual Studio 2012:
Project Properties-->Configuration Properties-->Build Events-->Post-Build Event-->Command line

tried this:
copy ../xkill-dependencies/dll/fmodex.dll .
copy ../xkill-dependencies/dll/fmod_event.dll .

and this:
copy ../xkill-project/xkill-dependencies/dll/fmodex.dll .
copy ../xkill-project/xkill-dependencies/dll/fmod_event.dll .
